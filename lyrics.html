			<br>Yeah, they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
			<br>They wishin' on me
			<br>
			<br>I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
			<br>Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
			<br>Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
			<br>You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
			<br>I don't wanna die for them to miss me
			<br>Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
			<br>Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
			<br>They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me
			<br>
			<br>God's plan, God's plan
			<br>I hold back, sometimes I won't (yeah)
			<br>I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
			<br>I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed
			<br>Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait
			<br>I go hard on Southside G, (yeah, wait)
			<br>I make sure that north-side eat
			<br>
			<br>And still
			<br>Bad things
			<br>It's a lot of bad things
			<br>That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
			<br>They wishin' on me
			<br>Bad things
			<br>It's a lot of bad things
			<br>That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
			<br>They wishin' on me
			<br>Yuh, ayy, ayy
			<br>
			<br>She said, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly"
			<br>I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry
			<br>Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
			<br>81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
			<br>And you know me
			<br>Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
			<br>Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
			<br>Imagine if I never met the broskies
			<br>
			<br>God's plan, God's plan
			<br>I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
			<br>Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close
			<br>I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy
			<br>Might go down as G.O.D., yeah, wait
			<br>I go hard on Southside G, ayy, wait
			<br>I make sure that north-side eat
			<br>And still
			<br>
			<br>Bad things
			<br>It's a lot of bad things
			<br>That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
			<br>They wishin' on me
			<br>Yeah, yeah
			<br>Bad things
			<br>It's a lot of bad things
			<br>That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
			<br>They wishin' on me
			<br>Yeah
